## Environment Setup Using Nitrous.io

We'll be using Nitrous.io as our main development environment with with our students this summer. Below you'll find the steps you need to take in order to set up your development 'box'. Flatiron will be covering the cost of the 'pro version' for both students and teachers.

### Initial Set-Up
+ Navigate to and sign up for [nitrous.io](https://nitrous.io/)(the pro version). Sign up, and confirm with two factor authentication.

+ I'll create a 'container' for you to work on, so when you log back in you'll see a link to that container on the left side of the screen.
