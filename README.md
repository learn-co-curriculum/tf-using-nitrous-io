## Environment Setup Using Nitrous.io

If you don't own a Mac, you can use Nitrous.io as your main development environment. Below you'll find the steps you need to take in order to set up your development 'box'.

### Initial Set-Up
+ Navigate to and sign up for [nitrous.io](https://nitrous.io/). Sign up, and confirm with two factor authentication.

+ Once you've signed up and reach the 'choose a box' page ____

+ I'll create a 'container' for you to work on, so when you log back in you'll see a link to that container on the left side of the screen.

+ Click on the link to your box and then on the button that says 'IDE' (which stands for Interactive Development Environment)

+ You'll now be in the IDE. It will look something like this:

### Connecting to Github
+ Finally, to set up a connection with your github account (so you can clone/push/pull), click on the 'account settings' link on the top right of the screen. Click on the 'add to github' button

+ Head back to your container dashboard and click on ssh keys, then connect your container to github

+ Last, open up the IDE and run the following lines (with your information):
  + `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
  + `git config --global user.name "Your Username"`


You're all set!
